Bayes Theorem
    Baye's theorem is an important theorem in statistics and probability which gives the probability of occurrence of an 
    event that is biased by another event that has already occurred

    In simple words, it determines the conditional probability of event A, given that event B has already occurred.




Difference between Conditional probability and Bayes Theorem

    Conditional probability: 

        Conditional Probability is the probability of an event A that is based on the occurrence of another event B.



    
    Bayes Theorem:

    Bayes's Theorem is derived using the definition of conditional probability. Baye's theorem formula includes two conditional probabilities.

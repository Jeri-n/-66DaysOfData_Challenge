# 66 Days of Data Challenge 

Learning is all about consistency. The quality and effectiveness of your learning process greatly depends on how consistent you are with the process. Without consistency you wont be able to finish it up what you have started off

This #66DaysOfData is a challenge initiated by Ken Jee on his youtube channel. In this, a consecutive 66 days are selected and a minimum of 5 minutes of your daily time is dedicated for studying something new in Data science

Along with studying the concept, you can also share it on your favorite social media platform too, like Linkedin, twitter, you can have discussions on discord, and you can add these into your GitHub repo too. Through this the problem of accountability will be solved. 

How to do it exactly ?
    We can divide the process into 3 steps:
1. Plan :
    This shouldn't take more than an hour. Because you know, most of us are good at planning forever and never really start it. So plan less, execute more.
Come up with a rough plan of the topics and sources which you are gonna use.
2. Start :
    For most of us this is the real challenge. Dont think too much, just start it off !.
Even if its a small theorem, or an algorithm or whatever it maybe, spend at least 15 mins of your day for this purpose. 
3. Track :
    This is crucial. The progress must be well observed. Share the knowledge you acquired daily on your social media platform, this will not only help others grow too but this helps to keep you accountable and allows you to socialize your work.

So what are you waiting for, grab books or laptop and start off today itself. Let's learn and grow together, and be accountable towards each other.

I will be posting daily updates on my LinkedIn, On my GitHub repository, and in my blog as well.

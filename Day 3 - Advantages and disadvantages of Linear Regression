1. Advantages of Linear Regression
------------------------------------------

It is Easy:
__________

Implementing linear regression is easy, and it is simpler to understand the output coefficients.


Easy to avoid over-fitting problem:
___________________________________

Over-fitting can occur with linear regression, however, it can be prevented by adopting cross-validation,
regularisation (L1 and L2) techniques, and some dimensionality reduction Techniques.




2. Disadvantages of Linear Regression
------------------------------------------

It assumes a Linear relationship:
__________________________________
A linear model is one in which the independent variables are assumed to linearly explain the dependent variable, 
such as a = bx + c. No exponential, logarithms, powers, etc. are permitted. Even though this is a great simplification, 
the real world is not linear. In order to achieve a linear representation, using a linear model would either require us to 
ignore some patterns or force us to use complex transformations.


Data must be independent:
_________________________

In the general case, that is not always true. But most linear model assumes that the variables in the model are not collinear. 
ie, they are not correlated.


The issue with Outliers:
________________________

The linear model assumes the points lie in a straight line and are relatively closer to neighbor points.
But in the case of outliers, since they are located too far, it'll be big trouble for the model performance.



Summary:
=================================================
Linear Regression is a great technique to analyze the relationships between the variables but it isnâ€™t recommended for most practical 
applications because it over-simplifies real-world problems by assuming a linear relationship among the variables.
